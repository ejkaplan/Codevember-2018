# Codevember-2018
Creative coding project per day for November, using prompts from http://codevember.xyz/.

## Day 1: Infinity
Nice pretty little spiral. Made with a bunch of circles whose center points are moving at a constant velocity around a circle and whose radii are increasing linearly.

## Day 2: Time
Maybe a little bit literal, but it was fun making a clock where the hour and minute hands move correctly relative to each other. Originally, I had the circular clock faces as well, but I think it looks more interesting if it's just the hands spinning on a black background.
